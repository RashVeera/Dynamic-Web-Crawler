### Dynamic Web Crawler

The Dynamic Web Crawler is a web application built using the Django framework that allows users to crawl and analyze webpage links from a given URL. The application utilizes the BeautifulSoup library for parsing HTML content and the Requests library for making HTTP requests. Users can input a starting URL, and the crawler will traverse through the webpages, extracting links and relevant information from each page. The collected data is then presented in an organized and user-friendly format on the application's interface.
